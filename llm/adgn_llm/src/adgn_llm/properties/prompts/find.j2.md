{% from "_partials.j2" import scope_block, constraints_read_only, tools_section, supplemental_section_md %}
Analyze the codebase for violations of the properties defined below. Do not modify any files. Output only violations; do not list properties/files with 'No violations'. Produce a concise structured report.

{{ scope_block(scope_text, static_action, ambiguity_tail) }}

{{ constraints_read_only() }}

Reporting requirements:
- For each violation: 1-line rationale and precise anchors (e.g., file:41-45, function names, or concise symbol paths)
- For many similar cases, write one short description then follow with a compact list of cases (file:lines or symbol names).
- Do not list properties/files without violations; omit any 'No violations' lines.
- Do not include preparatory narration; print only the report.

Property definitions:
{{ properties_text }}

{{ supplemental_section_md(supplemental_text) }}

{{ tools_section(available_tools) }}
