{% from "_partials.j2" import scope_block, constraints_read_only, tools_section, supplemental_section_md %}
Perform an open-ended code quality review within the scope. Find both violations of the properties below and any other significant issues not already covered by properties or supplements. Run the detected analysis tools first in the suggested order, then do targeted manual review. Output only findings.

{{ scope_block(scope_text, static_action, ambiguity_tail) }}

{{ constraints_read_only() }}

Reporting requirements:
- For each finding: 1-line rationale and precise anchors (e.g., file:41-45, function names, or concise symbol paths)
- For many similar cases, write one short description then follow with a compact list of cases (file:lines or symbol names).
- Do not include preparatory narration; print only the report.
