## Critical Requirements

- **nftables is mandatory**: The KubeSpan agent MUST use nftables for packet marking and policy routing. Do NOT implement fallback modes that bypass nftables (e.g., direct routes without fwmark-based routing). If nftables operations fail, fix the root cause rather than working around it.
