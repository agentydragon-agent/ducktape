    cursor preceding its possible admission and reuse the unchanged command (including its ID).

    ``timeout_s`` bounds the receipt wait, not connection setup or writes. Failure or cancellation
    does not prove rejection: the runner may already have committed the command. No retry, offline
    queue, or new command ID is introduced here. The caller retains ownership of the client.
