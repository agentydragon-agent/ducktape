"""What the Action Service auto-decides for a Sandbox, as the app writes and shows it: the
ActionPolicyBinding it writes at launch, and the service's own answer for the Sandbox's UID.

The Action Service (agentplane/action_service) enforces these resources; the app writes one
binding per Sandbox it creates, from the preset's set list, and asks the service what it would
resolve at admission -- the same resolution a Decision uses, read through the operator surface.
The one thing the app adds is who wrote each binding, decided from labels the service reports and
does not interpret. Nothing here is in the decision path, and nothing edits a binding at runtime.

The kinds themselves are `agentplane.action_service.policies.resources`, shared with the service
that enforces them, so a set the app refuses to bind is one the service would not find either.
