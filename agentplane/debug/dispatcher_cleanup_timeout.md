# Dispatcher cleanup timeout

The original CI invocation `6195e2a1-c114-51d5-b40d-dea24592409a` failed in
`test_deployed_dispatcher_wakes_only_opted_in_sandbox_for_app_and_notification_sends`. The
test's evidence file recorded `passed: true`, then `finally` cleanup timed out waiting for
`Ready.reason=Stopped` after the Sandbox reported `operatingMode=Suspended`. The Pod remained
running with one restart. Wake and admission assertions passed; stop and quiesce did not finish
before their deadline. The original artifacts do not establish why.

The focused uncached rerun, invocation `96eea856-53a1-42c5-b8c2-1ed7651be428`, passed in 169.880
seconds according to BuildBuddy `GetTarget` and did not reproduce the timeout, so it produced no
cleanup snapshot. The `bbr` wrapper separately returned 403 while fetching its outer invocation
(`336c9bc4-1177-4a82-b4ac-cde4e9120706`); this did not change the authoritative target result.

The system test now writes `dispatcher-cleanup.json` to undeclared outputs only when the wait for
`Ready.reason=Stopped` fails. It captures the Sandbox, Runner Lease, Pod, current and previous
runner logs, and recent Sandbox Controller logs concurrently, with a 30-second deadline per command;
completed results remain in the file when another command times out. Existing cleanup behavior and
wait timeouts are unchanged. If the failure recurs, use that snapshot to establish why the suspended
Sandbox and running Pod did not reach the stopped state before diagnosing or changing lifecycle
behavior.
