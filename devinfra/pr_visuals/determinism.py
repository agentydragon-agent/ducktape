"""Run visual targets repeatedly and report which renders are not reproducible.

A passing visual test proves the scene rendered, not that it renders the same pixels
twice. Left unchecked, drift is discovered as a misleading "X% changed" on somebody's
unrelated PR, weeks after the scene stopped being stable.

Two runs is the obvious check and is too few: a race that fires one time in five looks
perfectly stable across a pair, and the three instances this repo has already hit (an
unguarded Mantine animation, two mocked-fetch races) are exactly that shape. This runs N.

Only `visual-review.json` manifests are downloaded. Their assets are compared using
BuildBuddy's content-addressed artifact URIs, without downloading PNGs. Other PNGs are
reported as diagnostics and do not fail the sweep. Test failures still fail it.
