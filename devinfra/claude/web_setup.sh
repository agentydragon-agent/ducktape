# --- Step 1: Install Nix ---
# Write nix.conf BEFORE the installer runs. The installer internally runs
# `nix-env -i` which reads this config. Without it:
#   - build-users-group defaults to 'nixbld' (group doesn't exist in container)
#   - the install fails immediately
# We allow local builds here because `nix-env -i` builds a trivial
# user-environment.drv (just profile symlinks). Step 2 locks this down.

# --- Step 2: Lock down Nix for gVisor ---
# max-jobs=0: all real builds come from binary cache, gVisor can't build locally.
# sandbox=false: gVisor already provides isolation; Nix sandboxing would fail.
# Only our attic cache — cache.nixos.org is redundant since CI pre-pushes
# all closures to attic, and the extra cache lookups just slow things down.
