# claude_hooks TODO

## Nix Installation Timeout

**Problem**: Installing nix on Claude Code web times out because downloading nixpkgs takes >2 minutes (session start hook timeout).

**Current Workaround**: The `claude_hooks` package is installed via `uv tool install` from a pre-built wheel (published to GitHub releases), avoiding Python dependency installation during session start. Terraform tools (opentofu, tflint) are needed on PATH for `antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform` hooks (`terraform_validate`, `terraform_tflint`). Nix is installed separately for `nix eval` and flake operations. Nix formatting uses a static nixfmt binary (no Nix dependency).

**Potential Solutions:** See <docs/nix-speed-options.md> for detailed analysis. Summary:

- **Pre-built nix store tarball** (recommended) - CI builds closure, publishes tarball, session hook unpacks
- **Pre-computed store paths** - CI records paths, session hook does `nix copy`

## Auto-install Terraform Tools in Session Start Hook

**Problem**: The `terraform_tflint` and `terraform_validate` pre-commit hooks (via `antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform`) require tflint and opentofu on PATH. On Claude Code web (gVisor sandbox), these may not be available.

**Solution**: Consider auto-installing tflint and opentofu in the session start hook, so `pre-commit run` works out of the box for terraform changes.

## gVisor Dockerfile Build as Claude Code Skill

Consider turning <docs/gvisor_dockerfile_build.md> into a Claude Code skill (`.claude/skills/`) so Claude can automatically apply the `podman run`+`podman commit` workaround when asked to build a Dockerfile, rather than requiring the agent to read the docs first.
